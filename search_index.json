Aragón, MD, DrPH 2022-03-20 Testing This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() testing tikz for causal graphs Testing tikz for causal graphs Figure 0.1: Some caption testing running Julia x = [1, 2, 3] ## 3-element Vector{Int64}: ## 1 ## 2 ## 3 "],["preface.html", "Preface", " Preface Parts Leadership foundations Performance improvement Decision intelligence Science and technology "],["introduction-and-theory-of-change.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction and theory of change", " Chapter 1 Introduction and theory of change "],["cultivating-a-leadership-philosophy.html", "Chapter 2 Cultivating a leadership philosophy", " Chapter 2 Cultivating a leadership philosophy "],["transforming-self-and-interpersonal-relationships.html", "Chapter 3 Transforming self and interpersonal relationships", " Chapter 3 Transforming self and interpersonal relationships "],["transforming-teams-and-collaboratives.html", "Chapter 4 Transforming teams and collaboratives", " Chapter 4 Transforming teams and collaboratives "],["transforming-organizations-and-communities.html", "Chapter 5 Transforming organizations and communities", " Chapter 5 Transforming organizations and communities "],["scientific-problem-solving.html", "Chapter 6 Scientific problem solving", " Chapter 6 Scientific problem solving "],["lean-management-and-production.html", "Chapter 7 Lean management and production", " Chapter 7 Lean management and production "],["results-based-accountability.html", "Chapter 8 Results-Based Accountability", " Chapter 8 Results-Based Accountability "],["collective-impact.html", "Chapter 9 Collective impact", " Chapter 9 Collective impact "],["behavioral-economics.html", "Chapter 10 Behavioral economics", " Chapter 10 Behavioral economics "],["decision-quality-requirements.html", "Chapter 11 Decision quality requirements", " Chapter 11 Decision quality requirements "],["structured-decision-making.html", "Chapter 12 Structured decision making", " Chapter 12 Structured decision making "],["thinking-with-bayesian-networks.html", "Chapter 13 Thinking with Bayesian networks", " Chapter 13 Thinking with Bayesian networks "],["implementation-science.html", "Chapter 14 Implementation science", " Chapter 14 Implementation science "],["population-health-data-science.html", "Chapter 15 Population health data science", " Chapter 15 Population health data science "],["scientific-computing-with-julia-or-r.html", "Chapter 16 Scientific computing with Julia or R", " Chapter 16 Scientific computing with Julia or R "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
